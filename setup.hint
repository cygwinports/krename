sdesc: "KDE batch file renamer"
ldesc: "KRename is a powerful batch renamer for KDE. It allows you to 
easily rename hundreds or even more files in one go. The filenames can 
be created by parts of the original filename, numbering the files or 
accessing hundreds of informations about the file, like creation date or 
Exif informations of an image."
